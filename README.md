# **Youga**
This website is designed for people of all ages and skill level to begin or continue on their path of mind and body self improvement through the practise of yoga.

It will provide a breif introduction to what the youga community is about, the benefits of body and mind self improvement, importance of yoga towards these goals and list the 4 main yoga styles. It also allows users to become a member of the Youga community, by providin them with a personalised e-booklet based on their age and skill level, from their selected yoga styles through the use of an application form. 

## **Features**
The website features the 'Youga' name and logo which is immediately seen at the top left of the page upon opening. As viewers typically read from left to right this will be the first thing they see and already places the communitys name and image in their mind. 

To the right hand side of the header you will find the navigation bar which gives the user quick access to the different sections of the webpage with one simple click. Rather than use multiple pages for the website, the website is a single scrolling page which makes it a more user friendly when accessing via a mobile device and reduces the load time between pages.

On the landing/home section of the website, the user is shown a 'peaceful' image of someone practising yoga along with some cover text that clearly gives the impression of what it is they can expect Youga to be (Yoga, for your body and mind).

The structure of the website has been designed in a logical flow, first introducing what Youga is and about, followed by advice on why body and mind self improvement is important and how yoga can help with this. Finally, the page shows a woman practising yoga with the four main styles of yoga that Youga offer listed and underneath offers a form which allows the user to join the community and receive their own personalised e-booklet that includes techniques designed towards their age, skill level and style(s) of yoga they wish to practise. The layout of the main text sections are quite central, making them a focal point for the reader and also making the device responsiveness of the website easier to manage.

The color scheme has been designed to be simplistic and relaxing by using a limited amount of colours, which are subtle and calm to put the user at ease as if they were practising yoga. 

All images for the website have been formatted using Tiny PNG (which compresses them into a smaller filesize) and uploaded to the 'images' folder in the 'assets' database resulting in a more easily uploadable/quicker webpage.
